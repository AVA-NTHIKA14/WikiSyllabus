# ITT305: Data Communication and Networking

## Course Outcomes

* Discuss the basic concepts used in data communication and computer networking.  
* Identify the concepts of data transmission and apply signal encoding techniques in data transmission.  
* Compare different transmission mode, multiplexing, and spread spectrum techniques.  
* Describe the design issues and protocols in data link layer.  
* Summarize the routing algorithms.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Overview of Data Communication and Networks

* Types of computer networks, network software - protocol hierarchies, connection-oriented and connectionless hierarchies  
* Reference models - ISO-OSI reference model, TCP/IP reference model – comparison of OSI and TCP/IP reference models  
* Physical layer: guided transmission media – twisted pair, coaxial and fiber optics  
* Wireless transmission - radio and microwave transmission, communication satellites – GEO, MEO, LEO  
* Comparison of network hardware - repeaters, routers, bridges, gateways, and hub  

### Module 2: Data Transmission and Encoding Techniques

* Data and signals, analog signals, digital signals - transmission impairments  
* Data rate limits: channel capacity, Nyquist bit rate, Shannon capacity  
* Performance parameters - bandwidth, throughput, delay & jitter  
* Digital-to-digital conversion: line coding schemes - unipolar, polar, bipolar; block coding, scrambling  
* Analog-to-digital conversion: pulse code modulation, delta modulation  
* Digital-to-analog conversion: ASK, FSK, PSK  

### Module 3: Digital Transmission

* Transmission modes: parallel and serial transmission, asynchronous, synchronous, isochronous transmission  
* Multiplexing - TDM, FDM, WDM  
* Spread spectrum: frequency hopping spread spectrum, direct sequence spread spectrum, code division multiple access  

### Module 4: Link Layer Communication

* Data link layer – design issues  
* Error detection: parity check, checksum, CRC  
* Error correction: hamming code  
* Flow control: stop-and-wait, go-back-n, and selective-repeat  
* Random access: ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA  
* Controlled access: reservation, polling, token passing  
* Ethernet - ethernet cabling, encoding, frame format, binary exponential back off algorithm  

### Module 5: Network Layer

* Network layer design issues  
* Routing algorithm – optimality principle, flooding, distance vector routing, link state routing, multicast routing  
* Congestion control algorithms – general principles, congestion prevention policies, choke packets, random early detection  
* Quality of service requirements - buffering, traffic shaping – leaky bucket algorithm  
* Basic functions of transport layer and application layer (basic understanding only)
