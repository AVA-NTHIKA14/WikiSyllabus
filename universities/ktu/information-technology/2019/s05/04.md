# ITT303: Operating System Concepts

## Course Outcomes

* Explain the concepts and functionality of operating systems.  
* Describe the concepts of process management and process synchronization and apply them to solve problems.  
* Illustrate deadlock and deadlock – prevention and avoidance techniques.  
* Illustrate the memory management techniques.  
* Explain the file system and its implementation.  
* Use the disk scheduling algorithms to solve problems.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems

* Operating systems: introduction, functions of os, types of os (batch, multiprogrammed, time-sharing and real time systems)  
* System calls, system programs  
* System structure (simple structure, layered approach, microkernel system structure, modules)  
* Kernel, shell  

### Module 2: Process Management 

* Process management: process concept, process state, pcb, operations on processes, multithreading (benefits)  
* Process scheduling: basic concepts, preemptive scheduling, dispatcher, scheduling criteria  
* Scheduling algorithms: fcfs, sjf, priority scheduling, round robin scheduling, multilevel queue scheduling, multilevel feedback queue scheduling  
* Inter process communication: shared memory, message passing, pipes, and sockets  

### Module 3: Process Synchronization and Deadlocks 

* Process synchronization: race conditions, critical sections, mutual exclusion, busy waiting, sleep and wakeup, semaphores, monitors (introduction)  
* Deadlocks: deadlock characteristics, conditions for deadlock, prevention, avoidance (safe state, resource–allocation graph, banker’s algorithm), deadlock detection, recovery from deadlock  

### Module 4: Memory Management

* Basics, swapping  
* Memory allocation (fixed partitions, variable partitions)  
* Fragmentation, paging, segmentation  
* Virtual memory concepts, demand paging  
* Page replacement algorithms (fifo, optimal, lru)  
* Allocation of frames, thrashing  

### Module 5: Storage Management

* File system: introduction, file concept, file attributes, file operations, file types, file structure  
* File access methods: sequential access, direct access, indexed access  
* File allocation methods: contiguous, linked, indexed allocation  
* Directory structure: single-level, two-level, tree-structured, acyclic graph, general graph  
* Directory implementation: linear list, hash table  
* Disk management: introduction, disk scheduling algorithms (fcfs, sstf, scan, c-scan, look, c-look)
