# ITT202: Principles of Object-Oriented Techniques

## Course Outcomes

* Describe the specific capabilities of the object-oriented paradigm compared to the procedure-oriented paradigm.  
* Explain the use of object-oriented concepts to analyse the given problem.  
* Describe the different inheritance features available in Java.  
* Construct robust programs using exception handling.  
* Construct applets utilising multithreading, event handling, and graphical user interfaces; also model problem scenarios using UML diagrams.  

## Course Content
